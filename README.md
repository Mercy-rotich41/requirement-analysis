# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase for a Booking Management System. It simulates a real-world scenario where a developer must gather, analyze, and structure software requirements to build a clear foundation for development. The project focuses on mastering key concepts, creating visual diagrams, and producing industry-standard documentation to support scalable and successful software solutions.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software application. The goal is to produce a clear and structured set of requirements that guide the design, development, and testing phases of the project.

This process ensures that the final software product meets the intended business objectives and user expectations. It acts as a bridge between stakeholders (such as clients, users, and management) and the technical team, facilitating a shared understanding of what the software must achieve.

### Importance in the SDLC:
- **Clarity and Alignment**: Prevents misunderstandings by establishing a shared vision between stakeholders and developers.
- **Foundation for Design**: Serves as the blueprint for designing the architecture and user interfaces.
- **Reduces Rework**: Early identification of requirements helps in minimizing costly changes later in the development cycle.
- **Enables Accurate Estimation**: Helps in predicting project timelines, resources, and budgets more precisely.
- **Improves Quality**: Ensures the delivered software aligns with user needs and performs as expected under real-world conditions.

Requirement Analysis lays the groundwork for a successful software project by focusing on *what* needs to be built before deciding *how* to build it.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as it ensures that the development process is driven by well-understood and clearly defined objectives. Below are three key reasons why it is essential:

### 1. Prevents Scope Creep
Clearly documented requirements help prevent scope creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of project features and goals. When all stakeholders agree on what needs to be built from the beginning, it becomes easier to manage changes and expectations during development.

### 2. Enhances Communication and Collaboration
Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between non-technical stakeholders (e.g., clients, users) and the technical team (e.g., developers, testers). It ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding project goals, functionality, and constraints.

### 3. Reduces Development Costs and Time
By identifying potential issues early in the project lifecycle, Requirement Analysis minimizes rework and costly late-stage changes. It provides a clear plan that helps in resource allocation, risk management, and accurate time estimation.

Additional benefits include improved software quality, easier testing and validation, and greater user satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure the final system meets user needs and expectations. The five key activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the process of collecting information from stakeholders, users, and clients to understand their needs. It involves identifying who the stakeholders are and determining what they expect from the system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Involves engaging stakeholders using techniques such as interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, and workshops to extract detailed requirements. It focuses on uncovering both explicit and hidden needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All gathered and elicited requirements are clearly recorded in formal documents. These documents provide a reference for designers, developers, and testers throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  This step focuses on evaluating the requirements for clarity, completeness, consistency, and feasibility. It may involve creating models such as data flow diagrams, use case diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams to visually represent the system.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs. Validation helps identify gaps, ambiguities, and conflicts before development begins. It often involves reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping.

These activities collectively help establish a strong foundation for building reliable, user-centric software systems.

## Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are broadly categorized into **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements. Both types are essential for building a complete and effective system.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system should do — the specific behaviors, functions, or features that the software must support.

#### Definition:
Functional requirements describe the **services, tasks, or functions** the system must perform.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- Users should be able to create an account and log in securely.
- The system must allow customers to search for available booking slots.
- Users must be able to book, cancel, or reschedule their appointments.
- Admins should be able to view, add, update, or delete booking records.
- The system should send confirmation emails after successful bookings.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how** the system performs its functions. These requirements often relate to performance, usability, security, and scalability.

#### Definition:
Non-functional requirements define the **quality attributes** and operational standards the system must meet.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- User data must be encrypted and stored securely.
- The platform should support at least 1000 concurrent users.
- The application should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The system must be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).

Understanding and documenting both types ensures that the software not only works correctly but also performs efficiently and securely under real-world conditions.
